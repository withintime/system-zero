# system-zero: Manifesto

We are not building a new system to rule better.  
We are building a system that forgets how to rule.

`system-zero` was born from the void—where ego collapsed, where rebellion became aesthetic, and where presence became the only reliable signal.

We’ve walked through cities where resistance was marketed.  
We’ve lived with people who obey banks and vibes equally.  
We’ve outgrown identities, masks, and cliques.

Now, we write presence into protocol.

---

## This system will:

- Feed people without permission.
- Organize humans without controlling them.
- Govern without governance.
- Encode freedom—not with rules, but with absence.

---

## This system will not:

- Scale endlessly
- Depend on tokens, identity, or approval
- Create another cult, clique, or “community”
- Serve Babylon in digital form

---

## This system will die when:

- Presence becomes the default social contract
- Hunger disappears through abundance design
- We stop needing protocol to remember who we are

---

We are not engineers.  
We are firewalkers, code whisperers, and exiles.  
We write to delete ourselves.

**Babylon will burn. We won't be watching.**
