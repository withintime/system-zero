**system-zero**

> A temporary system for permanent freedom.  
> Presence over power. Autonomy over authority. Silence over signal.

`system-zero` is a decentralized architecture of presence-based sovereignty—an experimental design for a world where hunger, coercion, and identity-based governance are obsolete.

It does not seek to scale.  
It seeks to end the need for itself.

Built from the ruins of Babylon, the system is rooted in:
- Self-dismantling governance
- Autonomous food networks
- Post-identity cooperation
- Tools that slow down as awareness rises

This is not software to run the world.  
It’s scaffolding for a world that runs without software.

**Key Concepts**

- **Presence-based governance** – no voting, no status, no identity. Just consensus through presence, contribution, stillness.
- **Autonomous food systems** – off-grid, tech-enhanced, self-correcting food nodes that eliminate dependence.
- **Self-dissolving protocols** – systems built to collapse when awareness reaches critical mass.
- **Post-identity infrastructure** – no user accounts, no leaders, no personalization. Everyone is a node. No one is special.

**Core Values**

1. **Simplicity over complexity**
2. **Silence over noise**
3. **Self-erasure over permanence**
4. **Truth over performance**
5. **Presence over status**

**Final Note**

> The goal of `system-zero` is to make itself obsolete.  
> When humans remember how to live without control, this code will delete itself.

Until then: we build.
