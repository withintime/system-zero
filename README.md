# system-zero

> A temporary system for permanent freedom.  
> Presence over power. Autonomy over authority. Silence over signal.


This is not for developers.

This is for dissidents, food-hackers, ghost theorists, code monks, soil sorcerers.

`system-zero` is a decentralized architecture of presence-based sovereignty—an experimental design for a world where hunger, coercion, and identity-based governance are obsolete.

It does not seek to scale.  
It seeks to end the need for itself.

Built from the ruins of Babylon, the system is rooted in:
- Self-dismantling governance
- Autonomous food networks
- Post-identity cooperation
- Tools that slow down as awareness rises

This is not software to run the world.  
It’s scaffolding for a world that runs without software.

## Key Concepts

Presence-based governance –
*Like campfire consensus, but encoded — decisions happen when people show up, not sign in.*

Autonomous food systems –
*Decentralized food nodes designed to keep growing even if the grid collapses.*

Self-dissolving protocols –
*Tools that delete themselves as awareness rises — not built to last, built to liberate.*

Post-identity infrastructure –
*No names, no faces, just function. You are the tool. You are the node.*

## Core Values

1. **Simplicity over complexity**
2. **Silence over noise**
3. **Self-erasure over permanence**
4. **Truth over performance**
5. **Presence over status**

## Final Note

> The goal of `system-zero` is to make itself obsolete.  
> When humans remember how to live without control, this code will delete itself.

Until then: we build.
